                <p>
                  New Silver is a fintech startup that sits at the intersection of Decentralized Finance and real world assets. We build technology to originate and underwrite short term bridge loans with more efficiency, and securitize those loans on the blockchain with capital from DeFi protocols, helping to reduce costs and make securitizations more efficient.
                  We are the first real world asset in the world to be approved by MakerDAO, a top-3 stablecoin protocol. Our small and rapidly growing company is globally located and fully remote. New Silver’s mission is to enable entrepreneurial growth by providing real estate investors with fast, conveniently accessible capital, and by harnessing technology to improve investors' journey, from property search to sale.
